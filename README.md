What started as hacks seems to be growing into a bit more than hacks. So, I am creating a fork of Joomla 3.1.5's front-end PROTOSTAR template.

Using this fork for my new J!3.1 LaSalleMart.com.

##Notes:

* title is hidden in phones when both logo and title are displayed

* module position "header-hidden-phone": I put my main menu here so it is hidden in phones

* module postion "footer-visible-phone": I put a copy of my main menu here to display it in phones.

(I want my main menu to display in the footer for smartphones, in the header otherwise)


##LESS and CSS
* I did a no-no and modified template.css directly.
